Task0.py
The time complexity of task0.py is O(1). It is a constant time.


Task1.py
In this, I used two for-loops which is of different input (i.e calls(n) and texts(m)).
Since the loops are different and take different input, the time complexity is additive
The complexity is and the worst case O(n+m)


Task2.py
In this, I used two for-loops which means the alogrithm grows linearly as the input (calls) increases
The time complexity for this and the worst case is O(n+m)
wher "n" is the input of the first loop and "m" is the input of the second loop

Task3.py
In this, I used two for-loops of the same input lenght, one to generate the calls dictionary the second 
to iterate over the rows. I also used a for-loop to print the sorted list.
The time complexity and the worst case is O(n+n) + O(mlogm).


Task4.py
In this, I used four for-loops of different input lenght. The time complixity and the worst case is
O(k+l+m+n) where the variables represent the inputs to the loop respectively. 
It increase an any of the for-loop input length increases.
