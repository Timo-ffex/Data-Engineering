	- We start by showing you your carbon footprint in real time by using Open Banking technology to automatically track the carbon impact of each transaction you make as your making it (e.g. if you’ve just bought a sandwich, we’ll add the carbon impact of that sandwich to your ongoing carbon footprint)
	- With that information, we then give you hyper-personalised coaching on how to reduce your emissions across your lifestyle, from behavioural changes to where to shop
        - Finally we’ll automatically neutralise your remaining footprint by investing your money into the best offsetting projects around the world, normally for the price of about 2 cups of coffee a week! 

Revolutionising how easy it can be to manage your carbon impact effectively is the first step. The long term vision it that Minimum will make it so effortless, and so accessible live with a net carbon impact of zero that carbon neutral becomes the new normal for everyone.

The Good Food Institute,http://www.gfi.org,"GFI is a nonprofit working to create a sustainable, healthy, and just global food system. Plant-based, cultivated, and other alternative proteins offer a better way to feed the world.

The Challenge:
Current meat production is unsustainable and inefficient. It is a key driver of climate change, environmental degradation, and antibiotic-resistant disease. Yet these facts have not sparked significant behavior change: People are eating more meat than ever in the United States and
around the world.

GFI’s Solution:
We can create meat from plants or cultivate it directly from cells more sustainably and efficiently.
We will make more progress by changing the default choices than by trying to change every single person’s mind. GFI is accelerating the transition of the global food system to alternative
proteins by making them more delicious, affordable, and accessible than conventional animal products.

Our Programmatic Priorities:
SciTech: Bridging gaps in scientific research, funding, and talent across the alternative protein sector.
Corporate Engagement: Helping the food industry and investor communities put delicious, affordable alternative proteins on every menu and in every food retailer.
Policy: Advancing government investment in sustainable proteins as well as fair regulation and legislation.

GFI works around the world with team members based in the United States, Brazil, India, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Israel.

Spero Foods,https://www.sperofoods.co/,"People want plant-based dairy. But, today, plant-based dairy is prohibitively expensive due to the use of nuts as the primary ingredient. 
 
I created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.
 
At Spero, we make dairy from seeds. 
 
Why seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.
 
Spero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it’s comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.
 
By using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.

Your engineer is dedicated - which means 100% of their time is reserved for working on your project.

"Lucy Goods, Inc",https://lucy.co/,"If it isn’t bad enough that smokers don’t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product.",7,2016,"Los Angeles, CA"

Oncobox,http://oncobox.com,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would be most effective in fighting individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with a variety of late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock, they don’t always know which drug will be most effective for their patients, and because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

At an estimated cost of $2,000 per patient, the Oncobox Integral Test analyzes DNA and RNA of over 2000 genes that are included in major molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases and finds the right drug for them. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We are actively seeking partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. If you are in Oncobox for your patients, contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

Peer5,https://www.peer5.com,"Peer5's P2P CDN improves content delivery for live and on demand video streams. As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. 

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

Our video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",11,,Palo Alto
